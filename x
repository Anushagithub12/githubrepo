Automated QA testing relies entirely on specialized tools to execute test cases and generate results, whereas manual testers follow a written test plan and report the defects to developers. The two methods can be used concurrently, but each is best used in a specific area.

Manual testing is ideal for assessing the user experience (UX), and the look and feel of an application—which can only be done by a human. It’s most often used for newly-designed test cases, and on an ad-hoc basis for test cases with changeable requirements.

Automated testing runsss on frameworks created by testers. It’s suitable for large-scale software testing, and is generally more accurate than manual testing. The major benefit is that it saves time, especially in regression testing which can become tedious for manual testers.

the thing is the   manual testing. process cannot be recorded, but automation test scripts are reusable—so automated QA is a boon for repeated execution testing and successive development cycles. Automated tests can be run 24/7 without the need for manual input, although manual testing procedures can be used to cross-check results.
